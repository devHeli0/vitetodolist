# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Material UI

## Running APP

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Navigate to the `vitetodolist` directory and run the following commands:
  Development Mode
  - yarn (install the project dependencies)
  - yarn run dev

Building for production
- yarn (install the project dependencies)
- yarn build (Transpile TypeScript files, bundle the app, and optimize assets for production.)
- yarn lint (To lint the code using ESLint)
- yarn preview (Production-like environment.)

\*Access PASSWORD=1234

# Now you should have the "vitetodolist" app up and running on your local machine!
